        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> 
            Quinoa, (Chenopodium quinoa), plant species grown for its tiny edible seeds. As a member of the Amaranthaceae 
            family, quinoa is not a true cereal. Its seeds are high in protein and fibre, and its young leaves are also 
            nutritious and can be eaten as a vegetable similar to spinach (to which it is related).
        </p>

         <p> 
            Quinoa is classified as a pseudocereal rather than a cereal because it is not a true grass. As a grain, it has 
            a somewhat dull to nutty flavor. Quinoa leaves are medium green, alternate, broad, generally pubescent, smooth to 
            lobed, and lanceolate to triangular. Young leaves may be steamed or sautéed.

                 Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 
                 about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
