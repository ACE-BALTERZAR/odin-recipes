        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> 
            Polenta, a staple of Northern Italian cuisine, is traditionally made by adding cornmeal to boiling salted water 
            and stirring with a wooden spoon until your biceps aches! You can achieve the same results by letting your 
            Instant Pot® do all of the work for you! 
         </p>

         <p> 
            We like to serve this topped with browned Italian sausage and pork ribs that have simmered in a sauce made with
            onions, garlic, basil and tomato sauce until the ribs are falling off the bone-tender! Serve with additional 
            cheese, if desired. Delizioso! 
         </p>
         
         <h2> Ingredients </h2>
         <ul> 
            <li> 3 ¾ cups water </li>
            <li> 1 cup polenta </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons butter </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons heavy cream </li>
            <li> ½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
            <li> ½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
         </ul>

         <h2> Steps </h2>
         <ol> 
            <li> 
                Whisk water, polenta, and salt together in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). 
                Close and lock the lid. Select Porridge setting according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer 
                for 10 minutes. Allow 5 to 10 minutes for pressure to build.
             </li>

            <li> 
                Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 
                about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add butter and cream. Whisk until polenta is smooth and lump-free.
                Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Romano cheeses and whisk until melted and well combined.
            </li>           
         </ol>
