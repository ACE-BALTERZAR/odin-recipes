# odin-recipes

This project is concerned with the creation of a basic recipe website, which consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

A major objective of this project is to develop my HTML writing ability to a point where I can confidently showcase all I have learned so far, as well as become more familiar with "Brutalist Web Design", because it is a style of web design that really interests me, and I would love to incorporate this style into my skillset in the course of my web development journey.
